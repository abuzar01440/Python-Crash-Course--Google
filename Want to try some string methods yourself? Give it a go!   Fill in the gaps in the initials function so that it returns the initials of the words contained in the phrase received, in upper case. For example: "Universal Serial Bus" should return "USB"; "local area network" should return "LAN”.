Want to try some string methods yourself? Give it a go!


Fill in the gaps in the initials function so that it returns the initials of the words contained in the phrase received, in upper case. For example: "Universal Serial Bus" should return "USB"; "local area network" should return "LAN”.


def initials(phrase):
    words = phrase.upper().split()
    result = "".strip()
    for word in words:
        result += word[0]
    return result

print(initials("Universal Serial Bus")) # Should be: USB
print(initials("local area network")) # Should be: LAN
print(initials("Operating system")) # Should be: OS


Here is your output:
USB
LAN
OS

Awesome! You've filled in the correct string methods and
remembered how to use them! We’re getting through all this
stuff really fast now -- great job!
